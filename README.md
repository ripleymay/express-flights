# A simple flight tracker app

Mongoose-flights is a server-based app with **basic CRUD functionality**. Users can see an index page listing all flights and a detail page of a specific flight with it's respective destinations and tickets. Users can also create flights, destinations, and tickets, as well as delete tickets.

This app was built as an intro learning tool to Node, Express, and MongoDB and can only be ran on a local server.

## Next steps

Next steps include adding delete functionality to flights and destinations, as well as edit functionality to flights, destinations, and tickets. The app could also be refactored to implement user-centric CRUD functionality using a user login and authorization.
